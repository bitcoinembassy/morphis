The Creator
~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For your revelations.
    - For this existence, where truth and good are inherently superior to evil.
    - For my talents which have enabled all that I have accomplished.

Edward Snowden
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For changing the world by exposing the crimes against humanity being committed by the governments of the world. For risking his mortal life to do so. For knowing his life would not be the same, loss of family, homeland, Etc.  Before him, I would tell people what was going on, and they would call me crazy. Now, they claim they never thought I was crazy. That is an example of the contrast of this post-Snowden world with the impossible struggle to free people it was previously.

Someone
~~~~~~~
    - Who requested to not be named, but without which I would certainly not have been able to do this in time, not including the fact that I would be dead at the moment.

Satoshi Nakamoto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For showing me and everyone that technology can deprecate power structures that existed since eons past. Who would have thought that the most powerful entities in the world since the rothschilds started lending out other people's gold, even fictitious gold, who would ever have thought that they could ever be so completely DEPRECATED! He proved it can be done, and thus indicated that nothing stands against us doing the same with GOVERNMENT! Governance without government!
    - I would list Satoshi first, but Ed deserves to be on top for the non anonymous risk he took.

Linux Torvalds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For enabling me by having developed the ultimate operating system, and thus the ultimate development platform, learning tool, and more.
    - For showing us that open source community developed software can be vastly superior in fundemental ways (Ex: freedom) yet still be vastly superior in ways like quality to anything that any for profit corporations can ever create.

RMS
~~~
    - For explaining to people why we must control our own software, and why that means we must have access to all the source code to be safe.

Alykhan Jetha
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For mentoring me at the very start of my career, teaching me RDBMS and enterprise level/quality development, and even enabling my career that then positioned me with the very necessary and quality experience that has enabled me to be able to create MORPHiS!

Ian Clarke (and all freenetproject.org contributors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For inventing many of the concepts that MORPHiS is based upon.
    - For providing a platform for ideas to be invented.
        - For those who came up with the Web of Trust stuff, and thus freenet as a testing ground for such ideas.

Steve Dougherty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - By talking to him where he politely analyzed my ideas, pointed out flaws or the good, constructively, which quickly lead to me to invent MORPHiS's fundamentally important anti-entrapment feature.

real@freedomlayer.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For their awesome articles on Mesh Networking and DHTs up on freedomlayer.org. These showed me how it's suppose to be done; how you are suppose to combine math with computer science! If it weren't for these articles, I would absolutely still be in the planning stage -- instead of actually coding!

MANY OTHERS
~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Friends and family who've helped me through difficult times.
    - Super smart co-workers I learned much from early in my career and who made it a joy; people like: Grande Chevalier de la Candy Depot, Andrew Krasnov, and Scott Pont -- to name pretty much the smartest and main contributors in that regard.
    - Everyone who has contributed to any of the open software I use.
    - Everyone who has contributed to any open source software in any way. Together we are replacing the old paradigm.
    - Everyone working on open hardware to deprecate Satan's final piece of control over humanity.
    - Everyone who has written or contributed to any of the literature that I consumed which helped make MORPHiS, as well as my realization of the truth of the world, at all possible.
    - All those acquaintances who have shown me love, and that illustrated the fact that humanity is worth this long and truly difficult struggle to save!
    - Anyone and everyone who believed in me.
    - Every user and future contributor to MORPHiS!

For-profit Corporations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - For proving RMS right.

Governments of the World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - By being so inherently evil that working to deprecate you and your systems of 'necessary' evil is the best possible anti-depressant in this existence.
